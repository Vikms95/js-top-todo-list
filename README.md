- Ideas of what I want to apply to this project:
    - Factory functions
    - Modules
    -IIFES for functions to execute on boot up
    -Prototyping of objects (projects - todos)
    -DRY programming
    -Single responsability principle
    -Open Closed Principle
    
- What I learned with this project:
    - Use of ESLint
    - Handle localStorage
    - Read up the documentation for an external library (date-fns)
    - Handle JSON documents

Will revisit when learning how to apply better OOP, forms and make the contents of page refresh when a certain function is triggered
